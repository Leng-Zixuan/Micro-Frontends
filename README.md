# Micro-Frontends

A microfront is an architectural style that allows independently deliverable front-end applications to be composed into a larger whole.

### Architecture evolution of the micro front end

Monolith -> FE/BE Monolith -> MicroServices -> Micro Frontends

-   Monolith：Early development of an application does not separate the front and back ends, resulting in a project that is too large and bloated, and becomes difficult to maintain. This application is called megalithic application.

-   FE/BE Monolith：After experiencing the megalithic application, in order to solve the shortcomings of the megalithic application architecture, the front and back end separation was generated. Alleviating some of the disadvantages of difficult to maintain, large and complex projects.

-   MicroServices：Although the front and back end separation solves the huge and bloated overall project of megalithic application, with the development of The Times and the increasing personalized needs, the front and back end application is still a megalithic application. It did not fundamentally solve the problems caused by megalithic applications, so the back end was the first to produce microservices architecture. By popularizing the concept of granulation, the challenge to the back end is greatly reduced. It is also conducive to maintenance and individual deployment, and the coupling degree between various services is greatly reduced.

-   Micro Frontends：Today, the front-end is still a boulder application, because the concept of microservices has been verified the feasibility of the scheme and has quickly become the mainstream of the architecture of back-end applications, the challenge of front-end boulder applications is also explored with reference to the back-end microservices architecture, and the front-end large-scale projects are divided into independent sub-applications for maintenance.

### What does the micro front end really solve？

-   The code base in the business domain is not sufficiently independent and highly reusable

-   The same product features are developed by multiple teams/product features are difficult to maintain uniformity

-   New product ideas cannot be quickly reused/implemented in different applications

-   Iterate quickly on new subbusinesses/clean remove subbusinesses that will be eliminated

-   Improve construction efficiency

-   Improve delivery efficiency

-   Incremental architecture upgrade

-   Sub-team independence

-   ......
